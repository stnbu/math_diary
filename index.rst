I'm just trying to wrangle my python code and notes about math adventures ...by creating yet-another place to put them ...of course.

Mostly I wanted to try `a blog generated by Sphinx <https://github.com/sunpy/ablog>`_, which might turn out to be a nice way to blog about code ...that blogs about itself.

It's going well.
