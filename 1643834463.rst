Polynomial-Line Intersections

Knowing full-well that such things are already out there, I created a `python package <https://github.com/stnbu/polynomier>`_ to model polynomials.

My bigger goal is to wade my way through `Elliptic Tales <https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691151199/elliptic-tales>`_, a "popular mathematics" book that identifies as a graduate-level text book. It's a slog. :sub:`*`

I'll consider this the first post in a series about the book. As this is called "Math Diary", there is no ``math`` tag. It's all math. Isn't it?

So I won't feel too bad if occasionally I find myself writing multiple posts and new tools in order to comprehend
this material. I wasn't aware of this until just recently: writing python to model mathematical ideas is just the thing for upping my comprehension game and actually, counter-intuitively, making the going easier...and more enjoyable.

Using the above-mentioned library, I was able (victory!) to model the parameterized line equation substitution featured on p73:

.. include:: 1643834463_files/curve-line_intersect.py
   :literal:

whose output is

.. program-output:: python3 1643834463_files/curve-line_intersect.py

Pretty neat, eh?

The next page and a half get pretty deep for my waders. I hope *deriving* polynomial composition will make the going more intuitive.
