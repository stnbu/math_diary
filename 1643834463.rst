Polynomial-Line Intersections

Knowing full-well that such things are already out there, I created a `python package <https://github.com/stnbu/polynomier>`_ to model polynomials.

My bigger goal is to wade my way through `Elliptic Tales <https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691151199/elliptic-tales>`_, a "popular mathematics" book that identifies as a graduate-level text book. It's a slog. :sub:`*`

I'll consider this the first post in a series about the book. As this is called "Math Diary", there is no ``math`` tag. It's all math. Isn't it?

So I won't feel too bad if occasionally I find myself writing multiple posts and new tools in order to comprehend even just a page or two of this material. I wasn't aware of this until just recently: writing python to model mathematical ideas is just the thing for upping my comprehension game and actually, counter-intuitively, making the going easier...and more enjoyable.

Using the above-mentioned library, I was able (victory!) to model the parameterized line equation substitution featured on p73:

.. scriptdoc:: python3 1643834463_files/curve-line_intersect.py
   :output_language: text
   :source_show:
   :source_path: 1643834463_files/curve-line_intersect.py
   :source_language: python

Pretty neat, eh?

The text chose this parameterization (:math:`L`) such that :math:`g(0) = f(ξ, η) = 0`. What happens if we change :math:`L`? The fact that they intersect implies that :math:`g(t)` has no constant terms. Let's see if we can break that...

.. scriptdoc:: python3 1643834463_files/curve-line_nointersect.py
   :output_language: text
   :source_show:
   :source_path: 1643834463_files/curve-line_nointersect.py
   :source_language: python

Oops! A constant term!

Take a look at the plot of the original equations.

Since *intersecting* is key, and since things are symmetrical, it looks like we could just negate the line's slope and again, we will get :math:`L(t) = f(-1, -5) = 0`: another point where the two lines intersect and :math:`t=0`.

.. scriptdoc:: python3 1643834463_files/curve-line_intersect_negL.py
   :output_language: text
   :source_show:
   :source_path: 1643834463_files/curve-line_intersect_negL.py
   :source_language: python

Again, we got no constant term. The plot looks like you would expect.

   :output_language: html

Later in the book, some straightforward methods for choosing such an :math:`L` are discussed.

The next page and a half gets pretty deep for my waders. I hope *deriving* polynomial composition will make the going more intuitive.
