The big revelation that came to in me the few pages starting around p54 is...

.. important:: Letting the ``z`` of a homogenized polynomial in ``x,y`` has the effect of straightening the curve. With ``z=0`` the resulting curve is a straight line with the slope of ``[a : b: 0]``; the point at infinity that ends the original polynomial

For example, the following `sympy <https://www.sympy.org/>`_ snippet

tbd...

Now homogenize that same polynomial.


with ``z=1`` we get the *same* polynomial:

With ``z=0.5``, we get some amount of flattening:


The following are progressions from ``z=1`` to ``z=0`` in steps of ``0.1``:


We end up with a straight line!
